## 🚀 Income Classification Using Machine Learning
*Advanced Quantitative Methods and Machine Learning in Finance*

### Enhanced Business Framework:

**Business Question**: How can financial institutions and HR departments leverage machine learning classification models to predict high-income earners based on demographic and employment characteristics for improved risk assessment and strategic decision-making?

**Business Case**: In today's data-driven economy, accurate income prediction is crucial for credit scoring, salary benchmarking, and market segmentation. Traditional statistical methods often fail to capture complex relationships between demographic variables and earning potential. This comprehensive machine learning project provides a robust framework for income classification using real-world census data, enabling organizations to make informed decisions about credit risk, compensation strategies, and customer targeting.

**Analytics Question**: How can the systematic application of multiple classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine) combined with comprehensive model evaluation help analysts develop robust predictive models that accurately identify high-income individuals while providing interpretable insights for business applications?

**Real-world Application**: Credit scoring systems, insurance underwriting processes, targeted marketing campaigns, compensation analysis, and financial risk assessment

**Feature Importance Analysis:**
| Feature | Coefficient | Interpretation |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Sex Encoded | 1.268 | **Strongest predictor** - Gender significantly impacts income |
| Education Level | 0.337 | **Second strongest** - Higher education increases income probability |
| Age | 0.039 | **Moderate impact** - Age positively correlates with income |
| Hours Per Week | 0.035 | **Work intensity** - More hours correlate with higher income |
| Capital Gain | 0.0003 | **Minimal impact** - Limited influence on classification |

**Model Interpretation:**
The Logistic Regression model demonstrates strong performance with 82.83% accuracy. The model correctly identifies 880 low-income and 114 high-income individuals while misclassifying 206 cases total. Gender emerges as the most significant predictor with a coefficient of 1.268, followed by education level at 0.337. The model achieves good precision (68.67%) but moderate recall (42.54%), indicating conservative high-income predictions.

### 2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model

**Model Configuration:**
```python
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

**Performance Results:**
- **Accuracy**: 80.58%
- **Precision (High Income)**: 59.36%
- **Recall (High Income)**: 41.42%
- **F1 Score (High Income)**: 48.79%

**Confusion Matrix Results:**
```
                Predicted
Actual          ≤50K    >50K
≤50K             856      76
>50K             157     111
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/076ff4fc-f97b-480b-aecd-813bf439503c)


**Model Interpretation:**
The KNN model achieves 80.58% accuracy, slightly lower than Logistic Regression. With k=5 neighbors, the model correctly identifies 856 low-income and 111 high-income individuals. The model shows lower precision (59.36%) compared to Logistic Regression, indicating more false positive predictions. The non-parametric nature allows capturing local patterns but struggles with the class imbalance, resulting in reduced precision while maintaining similar recall performance.

### 3. Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model

**Model Configuration:**
```python
svm = SVC(kernel='linear', random_state=42)
svm.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

**Performance Results:**
- **Accuracy**: 79.92%
- **Precision (High Income)**: 64.21%
- **Recall (High Income)**: 22.76%
- **F1 Score (High Income)**: 33.61%

**Confusion Matrix Results:**
```
                Predicted
Actual          ≤50K    >50K
≤50K             898      34
>50K             207      61
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbc8018b-b20a-427e-8bbd-9d3935083a0f)


**Model Interpretation:**
The SVM model with linear kernel shows the most conservative approach with 79.92% accuracy. While achieving the highest true negative rate (898 correct low-income predictions), it severely underperforms in identifying high-income individuals with only 22.76% recall. The model demonstrates high precision (64.21%) when it does predict high income but misses 207 actual high earners, indicating the linear kernel may be too restrictive for this classification task.
